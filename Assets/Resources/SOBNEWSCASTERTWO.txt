Newscaster 2: In other news, the government has announced that travel between Westeria Island and Saint Marys Island will be restricted from tomorrow.
Newscaster 2: Here is what a government spokesperson had to say about the travel restrictions:
Government Spokesperson: We recognise that this may being significant disruption to the citizens of the Westral Federation, but we believe that this is in the best interests of everyone. We have enacted a temporary travel restriction (TTB) until further notice, as Harrison Felton is currently at large, and has been deemed to be very dangerous. We urge you to not approach him, and instead call 115 with the code-phrase FELTONSIGHTED.
Newscaster 2: Many islands have voiced disapproval at the TTB, as the ban will mean that people cannot travel across the country, but the government has listed people who are exempt from the ban. To view the full list, the government is urging people to go to www.gov.wf/travel-restriction/exceptions/ to find out who is exempt, and who is not.
