Newscaster 3: The mayor of Allerton Bay has criticised the Westrian government for acting too harshly in response to a travel ban imposed today. The ban, which came into force from yesterday, now means that most of the population is forbidden from travelling between islands via bridges, tunnels, ferries, and airports.
Here is what the Mayor of Allerton Bay, Susan Keswick, had to say about the governments TTB:
Susan Keswick: It is ridiculous! Why would you ban most of the country from travelling around just because one person robbed from WIT, and attempted to rob one of the biggest banks in the country? We have gangs that are rife in the country, but nothing has been done about them! I know that gangs are rife in West Insbury, but I do not see Westral Police paying any attention to them at all! We are supposed to be protected by the police, but this is too far in terms of protecting the country!
Newscaster 3: In response to the comments made by mayor Keswick, the commissioner of Westral Police issued a statement on the situation:
Mark Fawley: Due to the unprecedented actions of an individual of the Westral Federation, I advised the government to lock down travel between the islands, until police can identify where they have gone off to. While I can understand the comments made by Miss Keswick, I would like to remind Miss Keswick that her town falls outside of the TTB, and people are able to freely travel around the islands of Allerton and Baxton. The TTB only applies to Westeria and Saint Marys. However, there is a country-wide ban on domestic travel from air and sea. Airports and ports across the Westral Federation will remain open throughout the TTB, but no domestic flights will be running.
